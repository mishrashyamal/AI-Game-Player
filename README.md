# AI-Based Game Implementations: Rubik's Cube Solver, Maze Solver, and Othello AI

This repository features implementations of three AI-driven projects:

1. **Rubik's Cube Solver**: Solves a scrambled Rubik's Cube using advanced search algorithms.
2. **Maze Solver**: Employs Q-Learning to navigate a maze and optimize learning through exploration.
3. **Othello AI Player**: Plays the strategic game of Othello using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## Rubik's Cube Solver

### Description
The Rubik's Cube Solver uses search-based algorithms to determine the optimal moves for solving a scrambled cube efficiently.

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**
- **A* Search**




## Maze Solver

### Description
The Maze Solver employs a reinforcement learning approach, specifically **Q-Learning**, to discover optimal paths within a maze environment.

## Features
- Dynamically explores and interacts with the maze.
- Learns progressively through episodes by updating a Q-Table.
- Outputs a Q-Table that reflects the learned decision-making process.



## Othello AI Player

### Description
An intelligent AI agent designed to play the classic game of Othello (Reversi) with strategic decision-making powered by advanced algorithms.

## Features
- Implements the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for efficient and strategic gameplay.
- Configurable difficulty levels by adjusting the search depth.
- Compatible with both graphical interfaces and terminal-based play.
